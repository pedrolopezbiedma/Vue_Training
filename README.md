Projects inside the repository are:

- **firstApp**: First app created, aims for a basic knowledge of the Vue programming language. The app displayed a list of posts with different colums. These posts are obtained using axios plugin.

- **vuetifyApp**: Created while following a vuetify course to learn how to use this vue-UI framework. It displays a main page with a projects dashboard using some styling and filtering. These projects are loaded using Firebase & Firestore capabilities. You can create projects that will be displayed within the main dashboard and check yours in your section.

- **myProject**: First app of the course to learn the basics from Vue.

- **routing**: App created to learn the basics for the routing in Vue.

- **ninja-chat**: Chat between several users. App based on materialize UI-wise. Basically, X browsers can interchange messages between each other with this app :). As in the previous one, database & hosting for the app is done using Firebase & Firestore capabilities.

- **geo-ninjas**: Chat to geolocate logged users to the app. This is the final app of the course and in it we use all the adquired knowledge during all the sessions. As in the other projects, Materialize CSS for the UI. Maps are displayed using the Google maps API ( free version ). Besides, Firebase takes care of database & hosting as in the other, but in this case also handles the authentication.
